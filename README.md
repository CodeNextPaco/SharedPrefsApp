# SharedPrefsApp

This app demos how to use Shared Preferences to save data in an Android App. 
This is best used for small case needs, like high scores, user preferences since the storage capabilities are limited. 

You can save a simple contact (name, phone, email).

The app also shows how to manually set a "Dark Mode" in an Android app.
